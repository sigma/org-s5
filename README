This projects provides a glue to produce S5 based presentations from Org-Mode files.

INSTALL:
- copy org-s5.el somewhere in your Emacs' load-path
- (require 'org-s5) from your .emacs
- copy s5.org in your usual Org directory (optionally copy s5-demo.org as well, to export the demo presentation)
- Retrieve jquery.js (http://jquery.com/), and S5 (http://meyerweb.com/eric/tools/s5/)
- uncompress S5 (that will be a directory called "ui") inside your usual HTML export directory for Org
- copy jquery.js and org-slides.js (from this project) into this "ui" directory

Now you're ready to export an Org file as a S5 presentation



Supported features:
- Top-level entries are mapped to slides
- Org tags are used for S5 "uncover" feature
  Use "Incremental" and "ShowFirst" on the parent of the list you want to uncover step by step (see s5-demo.org for an example)
- External links are taken into account
